# Heros of Pymoli

## Background

This project utilizes Pandas and Numpy libraries to analyze the data of a gaming company's most recent game (Heros of Pymoli).

Like many other games in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

## Task

Create a report using Pyton-Pandas and Numpy in Jupiter Notebook

The report should include:

- Player count
- Purchase Analysis (Total)
- Gender Demographics
- Purchasing Analysis (Gender)
- Age Demographics
- Top Spenders
- Most Popular Items
- Most Profitable Items

## Analysis

Out of the total players only 14% are female. Based on the Purchase Analysis (Gender) table it would be profitable to attract more female players as they spend $0.46 more than male players on average.

It is worth taking a deeper dive into why there is large gap between players in the Age Group 15-19, 20-24  and 25-29. 
But for this type of analysis it will be necessary to know how long user been playing the game.
For the younger players: Is the game learning curve hard? Are there other games more relevant for that age group?
For the 25-29 players: Why is there a large drop after age 24? Is the content not relevant after certain age? 
Is there need for expansion packs?

The most popular in game items do not have a large purchase count. Are there game conditions that not allow the player to purchase certain items? How can we increase the total sales of such items?
